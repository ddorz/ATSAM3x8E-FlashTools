FlashTools

This API provides an interface with the ATSAM3X8E microcontroller’s embedded flash controllers and memory protection unit. It is for use specifically with the ATSAM3X8E MCU/Arduino Due.

Internal flash writes/reads allow non-volatile data storage of program data using flash memory. Additionally, the API includes functionality for locking/unlocking flash, getting the flash descriptors, setting/getting the GPNVM bits, and getting the Cortex-M3’s 128-bit unique identifier. Moreover, it provides functionality for enabling and using the Cortex-M3’s integrated Memory Protection Unit (MPU). 

For more information on this API refer to FlashTools.pdf, and for technical details regarding the ATSAM3X8E refer to the chip’s datasheet, included here as at91sam-datasheet.pdf.
